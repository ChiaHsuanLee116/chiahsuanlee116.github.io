  We propose a new interface formation method for shock–interface interaction studies by using the super-hydrophobic–oleophobic surface instead of filaments to constrain the soap–film interface. To verify this method, developments of a single-mode air–SFinterface and a heavy gas layer accelerated by shock waves are experimentally investigated and compared with the previous studies. For single-mode interface developments, experimental schlieren images show that the interfaces are more fully developed, and the thickness of the interface profile reduces more than 60%. For shock-induced heavy gas layer instability, the interface profile is more distinct, and the mixing width of the upstream interface after it passes through the initial position of the downstream interface is largely weakened. Quantitative comparison shows that the filaments used to constrain the soap–film interface have a significant effect on the movement and amplitude growth of the upstream interface, and the superiority of the present method is well demonstrated.
