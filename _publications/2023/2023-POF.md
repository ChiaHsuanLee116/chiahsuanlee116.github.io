  Richtmyer–Meshkov (RM) instability of a single-mode SF$_6$–air interface subjected to a convergent shock is investigated experimentally. The convergent shock tube is specially designed with an opening tail to weaken the Rayleigh–Taylor effect and eliminate the reflected waves' effect. The gas layer scheme is used to create a heavy gas environment at the upstream side of the interface. Before phase inversion is finished, the amplitude reduction is accelerated, but the Bell–Plesset (BP) effect in this process is found to be negligible. After phase inversion is completed, the linear growth rate is generally predicted due to small amplitude and the weak BP effect. In nonlinear regime, an existing nonlinear model is revised based on the Padé approximation to give a better prediction of amplitude growth. The spike amplitude grows almost linearly, whereas the bubble amplitude gradually saturates and even reduces. For a heavy-light interface in convergent geometry, although both the spike and bubble amplitude growths are promoted by the BP effect, the spike growth is more promoted than the bubble. The BP effect enhances generation of the second-order harmonic, which results in saturation and reduction of the bubble amplitude. The discrepancy in the BP effect between light-heavy and heavy-light interfaces is qualitatively demonstrated for the first time.
