  Numerical simulations and theoretical analysis are conducted to investigate the Atwood-number dependence of perturbation evolution in a shocked heavy fluid layer. For layers without reverberating waves, a higher Atwood number of one interface significantly enhances its coupling effect on the perturbation growth at the opposite interface. A theoretical model incorporating the startup, linear and nonlinear stages is developed to predict the interface mixing width. Dimensionless formulae are derived, identifying eight distinct modulation regimes of multi-interface instability.
