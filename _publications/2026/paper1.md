  The evolution of a rippled shock transmission through slow--fast interfaces is investigated, considering the phase-dependent initial conditions generated during transmission. A matched solution is first constructed by mapping the transmitted-shock initial amplitude and growth rate to an equivalent isolated-shock evolution, but only provides accurate predictions in the early stage. Then a generalized analytical model is derived by reducing the pressure-perturbation dynamics to the Klein--Gordon equation. The resulting Bessel-series solution retains the even-order terms that vanish in conventional initial-phase formulations, thereby enabling good prediction of transmitted shocks initiated at an arbitrary phase with nonzero initial pressure and normal-velocity perturbations. The results show that although the rippled transmitted shock evolution may be weakly sensitive to the detailed form of the boundary condition, it depends strongly on the relative shock--interface distance through acoustic feedback. Each slow--fast transmission significantly increases both the attenuation rate and the oscillation frequency of the shock-front perturbation. Using the explicit dependence of transmitted-shock initial conditions on the shock--interface parameters, we determine the optimal parameter combinations for suppressing corrugations, enabling active control of transmitted-shock perturbations.
