  The coupling of Richtmyer–Meshkov instability (RMI) and Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI), referred to as RM-KHI, on a shock-accelerated inclined single-mode air–SF$_6$ interface is studied through shock-tube experiments, focusing on the evolution of the perturbation distributed along the inclined interface.
