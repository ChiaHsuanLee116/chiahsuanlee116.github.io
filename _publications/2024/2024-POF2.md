abstract: >-
  Development of a heavy gas layer with an upstream single-mode interface and a downstream planar interface accelerated by a shock wave is investigated. By considering the amplitude variation of the transmitted shock and interface coupling, a modified model is established, which provides good predictions on the linear growth rates of the perturbations on both interfaces.
