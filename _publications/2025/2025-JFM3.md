  The dependence of the Richtmyer–Meshkov instability (RMI) on post-shock Atwood number ($|A_1|$) is experimentally investigated for a heavy–light single-mode interface. We create initial interfaces with density ratios of heavy to light gases ranging from 1.73 to 34.07, and achieve the highest $|A_1|$ value reported to date for gaseous-interface experiments (0.95).
